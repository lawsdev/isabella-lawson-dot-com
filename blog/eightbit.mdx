I studied art scholastically for 10 years. I’ve always been interested in combining art with technology. What led me to decide I was a creative person was making video games with a now defunct website that worked like [MIT’s Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Video games are the closest visual medium to computer science (apart from corporate illustrations.) 

Fine art is usually taught chronistically, starting from Greek columns and working towards post-modernism. Teachers lamented that contemporary art was taking a digital direction, and discounted anything digital from class. Even mechanical pencils were banned because of their technological properties. 
I was deviated from my Microsoft Paint asset roots - instead taught to draw Doric columns and self portraits in German expressionist style. Now that I’m not studying art under a stickler any more, I am free to make whatever I want. Which is a headache in itself. 

8-bit art has a reductive design appeal, where the creativity lies in making an object legible with very few pixels. It also has an effect of making things look cute or nostalgic. Indie game developers like it because it takes up little space - and they don’t have to spend so much money on high-res art. *NOW NOW - if i’m driving you up a wall calling it 8-bit instead of pixel art, think of how most people in america at least call a curad brand bandage a bandaid. It’s an eponym.* 

> **8-bit color** graphics are a method of storing image information in a computer's memory or in an image file, so that each [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) is represented by 8 bits (1 [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)). The maximum number of colors that can be displayed at any one time is 256 or 2x8.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_color#cite_note-HIPR_8-bit_Color_Images-1)

I chose to use 8-bit style to create a greeting card generator because narrowing my options down simplifies things. I liked the challenge of having to reduce something to a small size. Systematizing things by having certain visual standards is my recursive solution to creating assets for 

my design system:

- insert photos of experimenting with a crow
- the best one is the one in the middle
- black outline for visual consistency, makes the design stand out ‘pop’
- deciding what to draw

Recursion, 

CSS systems

Taking breaks from installing MONGO db to draw.

So it’s like problem solving.
